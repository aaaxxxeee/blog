In September 2024 I had the opportunity to be apart of the small group who worked on the closing party of the MAPP_MTL festival which took place on September 29th 2024 at Moment Factory.

I have worked on multiple aspects of the event from creative works (3D and compositing) to interaction design and mapping.

I've also collaborated on a VJ set with Maxime Simmard.

The visuals on these drapes were made by Anamika Deb while the surface was mapped by me and Bonnie Pham
